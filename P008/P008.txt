# Sorted Array of integers

We were tasked to create a program that had us fill an array that it would sort, then 
print it with the sum of the elements and to implement a binary search function. In order to compile 
and run this program, you must load it into SpimQT,
hit compile and then run it. The program will repeatedly tell you to
give it an integer until each array is full or you enter a negative integer.
That negative integer works as the sentinel value, meaning it's technically in the array
but is not acknowledged the the methods. It's only there to mark the end of the array.
Once it is full, it will display the sum and the sorted array.
Inputing anything other than an integer will result in an error.
The program will then prompt you for an integer to search the array for. 
If it's in the array, it will return it's lowest index. If it's not in the array,
it will return -1. Entering a non-integer value will result in an error.
