We were asked to build a 32 bit ALU with the functions to add, subtract, detect 
if to inputs were equal, and detect if one of those inputs were greater than the other.

This was my test case code:

A B op C Overload Negative Zero
1 1 0 2 0 0 0
32 32 0 64 0 0 0
5 2 1 3 0 0 0
5 10 1 4294967291 0 1 0
2147483648 2147483648 0 0 1 0 1
1 4 2 1 0 1 0
4 1 2 0 0 0 0
11 11 3 1 0 0 1
12 11 3 0 0 0 0
