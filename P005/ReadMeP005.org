In my circuit I have reset and load as the selector bit to two MUXs.
If load is set then it loads the value of D, otherwise it adds 4 to the loaded address.
Then if reset is set, it loads 0 into the output, otherwise it allows D to pass through.
In order to change the priority of the inputs, i would change the order of the MUXs.
